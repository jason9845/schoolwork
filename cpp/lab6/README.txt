I use "push" function to add elements to the beginning of the linked list.
This makes sure that the elements are stored in a reversed order, which I can
use to write to the output file.

I read each line until "null;" is seen, separate the characters on "->"
and store them in the linked list. I then write the linked list to the output
file, free the memory on the heap and move to the next line. The loop quits
when end of file character is seen.

The program can be compiled using "g++ reverse.cpp -o reverse" or the Makefile.
The output file is "reverse", which can be executed using "./reverse".
